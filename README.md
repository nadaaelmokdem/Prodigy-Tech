Prodigy Tech - Cybersecurity Projects

Welcome to Prodigy Tech's repository for cybersecurity projects!

This repository houses Python programs designed to explore fundamental concepts in cryptography and password security.

Projects:

Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption (CLI):

This Python script implements the Caesar cipher, a classic encryption technique that shifts letters by a specified number of positions (key).
Features:
Encrypts and decrypts text messages using the Caesar cipher.
Accepts user input for the message and key.
Provides a command-line interface (CLI) for convenient interaction.
To Use:
Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/prodigy-tech-cybersecurity.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd prodigy-tech-cybersecurity
Install dependencies (if any): pip install <package_name> (Replace <package_name> with any required packages)
Run the script: python caesar_cipher.py (Replace caesar_cipher.py with the actual script name)
Follow the prompts to enter your message and key.
The encrypted or decrypted message will be displayed.
Password Complexity Checker:

This Python program evaluates the strength of passwords based on various complexity criteria.
Criteria: (You can customize these criteria as needed)
Minimum length (e.g., 8 characters)
Inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols
To Use:
Follow the same steps as for the Caesar cipher script.
Enter your password when prompted.
The script will analyze the password's complexity and provide feedback on its strength (weak, moderate, strong).
About Cybersecurity:

Cybersecurity is a crucial field that focuses on protecting systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. This repository provides a starting point for exploring essential concepts in cryptography and password security, key components of robust cybersecurity practices.

Additional Notes:

Feel free to extend these projects by implementing more complex encryption algorithms, password strength meters, or vulnerability scanning tools.
Consider adding unit tests to ensure the correctness of your code.
Explore secure coding practices to minimize vulnerabilities in your programs.
